My name is Max and iÂ´m a software developer living in Switzerland. I love open source, javascript and generally building things. 

##Why am i doing this blog?

As i love to work on side projects and hack on nifty little pieces of software i happen to 
learn a lot on different topics and stumble across many problem. 

This blog has the purpose to show off cool hacks, and solutions to problems i had. 

The plan is to write a blog post each week but i'm not sure if i can fulfill that promise.

##The setup

The blog is built om the awesome [Octopress](http://octopress.org) which is a blogging framework built on the [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)
static site generator. 

Octopress offers the availability to write the texts in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) (which i a great markup language that is being compiled to html code), has a great code embedding view and happens to have a lot of plugins available. It is very leightweight as it only consists of static files and can easily be hosted anywhere. 

The source code for my blog lays in an own [Github repository](https://github.com/MaxGfeller/maxgfeller.com), so that i can access it from everywhere and write 
new blog posts very quickly. 

The blog itself is hosted at [Cyon](http://cyon.ch) - where i work - and available under maxgfeller.com. 

Octopress/Jekyll offers
various ways to easily deploy the site to a server. Because i have ssh enabled at my webhosting i chose rsync: deploying is now as easy like typing `rake deploy`
